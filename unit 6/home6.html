<h1> CONCEPTUAL AIRCRAFT DESIGN </h1>

<h3 id ="dp">Design process </h3>
<p> Design is the activity you carry out to achive a specific goal. It is not an one time process, it is iterative </p>
<p> Particularly an aircraft design involves main focus on the mission requirement. It is to be designed so as to meet the desired performance aspect for a 
particular mission. In this design process an important parameter is "Compromise/Trade off". </p>
<p> Because for example a long range highly stable aircrafts are very poor in maneuverability. In the same way a high wing loading aircarft cannot give you a minimum drag.</P>
 <p> Aircraft design process is all about optimizing all the performance aspects with a higher focus to the mission specific parameters</p>
 <img src = "images/design.png" alt= "flow chart" height = "300px" width = "300px" />
 <p> The major areas in aircraft design includes </p>
 <ul>
 <li> Better Aerodynamic design so as to reduce drag </li>
 <li> Light weight stuctures </li>
 <li> Appropraite powerplant selection as per the mission </li>
 <li> Flight contol system design </li>
 </ul>
 Some of the desing aspects to be looked in to are
<ul>
<li> Payload characteristics </li>
<li> Range and Endurance </li>
<li> Take-off and Landing distance </li>
<li> Rate of climb </li>
<li> Cruise altitude </li>
<li> Turn radius and turn rate </li>
</ul>

 <li> Technological advances made through research and development </li>
